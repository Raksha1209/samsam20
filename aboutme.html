             Crafting this for you left my hands sore, but hey, even if it looks a bit noobish,
              I know  you'll like it. It's been over a year of sharing moments with you.
               And you know what? I've realized that it's not about  trips, dates, or others.
                For me, all I need is a plate of biryani, a refreshing drink, and a cozy sofa
                 with our favorite show. That's the surprise secret I've been hinting at!
                  Here's to more wonderful years together. Cheers to us!"</p>
